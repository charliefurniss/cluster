# cluster-test

> A Vue.js project

## Assessment

I have only partially met the task criteria. 

I am displaying results of search based on scan-type on the page and have a crude function to filter the data by path name.

Because I haven't yet paginated the data, I have limited the API call to size=50.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
